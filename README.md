## 📝 Abstract

Today, companies need to carry out their processes efficiently with the help of new technologies. Over the years, **data management systems** have progressively become essential for businesses. These systems enable internal processes to be much more efficient, and since efficiency is crucial for any company aiming to grow and achieve its medium and long-term objectives, their implementation is indispensable.

With this goal in mind, this project was proposed to design and develop a **web ecosystem** that enables a business federation to manage its databases in a **more secure, simple, and efficient** way.

Throughout the project, the following were implemented:
- An intuitive graphical web application that allows users to manage all information visually.
- A **REST API** that enables HTTP requests to the system and access to the stored data.

Thanks to this new system, with its **low learning curve**, internal processes related to data management can be accelerated from the outset, while ensuring **better security and controlled access** to information.
